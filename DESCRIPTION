Description: Unit testing is a solid component of automated CI/CD pipelines. 'tinytest' - a light-weight,
	zero-dependency  alternative to 'testthat' was developed. To be able to integrate 'tinytests' results into common CI/CD
	systems the 'tinytests'-object needs to be converted to JUnit XML format. 'tinytest2JUnit' enables this conversion
	while keeping the zero-dependency nature.
