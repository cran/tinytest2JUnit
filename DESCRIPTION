Description: Unit testing is a solid component of automated CI/CD pipelines. 
	'tinytest' - a lightweight, zero-dependency  alternative to 'testthat' was developed.
	To be able to integrate 'tinytests' results into common CI/CD systems the test results from 
	tinytest need to be caputred and converted to JUnit XML format. 
	'tinytest2JUnit' enables this conversion while staying also lightweight 
	and only have 'tinytest' as its dependency.
